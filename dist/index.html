      <h2>👩🏽‍🚀 Projects</h2>
      <p>
        I have done a user authentication backend application using nodejs, the main purpose of this project is to
        safeguard our password, Users credentials stored in the application is hashed with different hashes, it
        overwrites the password with hashes, so our password will be secured. Our original password remains the same it
        just overwrites for security purpose.
        This application uses express for server and bcrypt for hasing, the credentials looking forward to work on new
        technologies and new projects.
